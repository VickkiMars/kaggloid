## **Description**  

This repository is focused on the Kaggle competition **[News Articles Semantic Similarity](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/newssimil/overview/description)**.  

Key objectives:  
1. Leverage advanced **topic modeling techniques** to represent news articles.  
2. Develop methods to compute semantic similarity between article pairs effectively.  
3. Analyze results and optimize for improved performance on the leaderboard.

## **Evaluation**  

The performance of submissions is evaluated using:  
**[Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/newssimil/overview/evaluation)**  

This metric measures the monotonic relationship between the ground truth and predicted similarity scores. Higher correlation coefficients indicate better performance.
